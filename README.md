This is an full stack React + nodejs app in which we have two directories client and server.

######  The main Goal is to deploy this app using Shell script. ############

You can go to Deployment stage of this project by using deploy.sh file.
You need to follow these steps:- 

1. give permission :-   sudo chmod +x deploy.sh
2. Run the script :- ./deploy.sh

it will ask some details like if you want to clone this repo you just need to save this deploy.sh file and run in your terminal after that you just need to provide github repo and branch name then some version related question so using this this willl automatically build and create the node modules of any node js application.
